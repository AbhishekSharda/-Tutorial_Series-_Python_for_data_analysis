# Python for Data Analysis
In this introduction to python tutorial series I tried to explain the basic functionality of python programming language that is required to perform most of the tasks in data analysis.

I designed this tutorial series in such a way that a complete beginner in python language (interested in performing data analysis with python) can immensely benefit by following the code examples used throughout series.Moreover, it can serve as a refresher for data analysts,data scientists, or anyone who use python in their evryday work

These tutorials are divided into different parts, each part attempts to explain differet aspects of python.
### Part-1 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained use of Print command and variables used in python.

### Part-2 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained Keywords and identifiers and type conversion in python.

### Part-3 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained OPERATORS used in python.I explained Arithemetic operators,Logical operators, Bitwise operators, Assignment operators,Membership operators.

### Part-4 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained Loops which are important concept of any programming language.
    *   While Loop
    *   If-Else Loop
    *   For loop
    *   Nested Loop

### Part-5 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained STRINGS which is another very important data type for data analysis.I performed Arithmetic operations on strings,relational operation and many more.

### Part-6 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained LISTS which is another very important data type for data analysis.
I expalined different ways to access strings and substring.

### Part-7 Python for data analysis
In this part of tutorials I explained SETS which is another very important data type for data analysis.
